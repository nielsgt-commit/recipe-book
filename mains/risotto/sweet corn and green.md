Anna Jones’ corn and green chilli risotto.

Prep 10 min
Cook 60 min
Serves 4

## Ingredients
3 corn on the cob
800g vegetable stock
Extra-virgin olive oil
1 stick celery, finely choppe
1 white onion, peeled and finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
Salt and black pepper
200g risotto rice (I use carnaroli)
250ml (a large glass) white wine
60g parmesan or vegetarian parmesan-style cheese, plus extra to serve
1 large knob butter
1 green chilli, deseeded and very finely chopped


## Instructions

First, cut the corn kernels from the cobs into a bowl, then chop the shaved cobs into three.

Pour the vegetable stock into a deep pan, add the chopped cobs and bring to a simmer, then keep warm on a low heat while you make the risotto, as you’ll want it to be hot when adding it to the rice.

In a food processor, blitz a quarter of the kernels with a tablespoon of stock, until smooth and creamy; set aside to add later.

Meanwhile, heat a little olive oil in a large pan, add the celery, onion and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook on low for 10-15 minutes, until everything is soft and sweet, but not browned. Turn up the heat, add the rice and stir for a couple of minutes to seal the grains, then add the wine and let it evaporate.

Once all the wine has evaporated, turn the heat down to medium-low and start adding the stock a ladleful at a time, allowing each ladleful to evaporate as you stir it in. When half the stock has been added, stir in the remaining corn, then continue adding the stock until the rice is cooked but still has a little bite to it, and the corn is tender. This will take about 30 minutes in total.

Remove the risotto from the heat and stir in the cheese, blitzed corn, the butter and some salt and pepper. Pop a lid on top and leave to rest for a minute or two, then serve immediately, topped with a little extra grated parmesan and the chopped chilli.
